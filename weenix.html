            <div class="paragraph1">I chose to invest time into creating a deeper understanding of the way that a computer utilizes and understands software, allowing me to further comprehend the amount of work that a computer does.</div>
            <div class="paragraph2">The various steps of this project were processes, threads, drivers, a virtual file system then an s5fs variant and finally implementing virtual memory from scratch. The experience of implementing multi threading in the beginning of the course to eventually implementing forking at the end was an instrumental cause in me eventually choosing systems to be my second pathway on my course to pursue an scb.</div>
            <div class="paragraph3">While these skills might not directly transfer to what I want to do in industry, the experience and diligence that the course taught me is a skill that I’ll carry with me to the future as I continue to grow.</div>
            <div class="paragraph4">If you would like to discuss the project in depth please feel free to email me! Due to academic policies I’m limited in what I’m able to share, but am always available to provide a demonstration if asked.
